# Precintos Page Debugging Guide

## Console Logs Added

I've added strategic console.log statements throughout the Precintos page to help trace where the issue might be occurring:

### 1. **App.tsx**
- `App: Rendering authenticated user routes` - Confirms user is authenticated
- `App: Rendering PrecintosPage route` - Confirms the route is being matched

### 2. **Layout.tsx**
- `Layout: Rendering with children:` - Shows if the Layout component receives the PrecintosPage

### 3. **PrecintosPage.tsx**
- `PrecintosPage: Component rendering` - Confirms component is mounting
- `PrecintosPage: useEffect triggered, filters:` - Shows when useEffect runs
- `PrecintosPage: loadPrecintos called` - Confirms data loading starts
- `PrecintosPage: Calling precintosService.getPrecintos with filters:` - Shows service call
- `PrecintosPage: Data received:` - Shows what data was returned
- `PrecintosPage: Error loading precintos:` - Shows any errors during data fetch
- `PrecintosPage: About to return JSX` - Confirms render is starting
- `PrecintosPage: Inside main div` - Confirms JSX is being evaluated

### 4. **PrecintosService**
- `PrecintosService: getPrecintos called with filters:` - Shows service method execution
- `PrecintosService: DEV mode, returning mock data` - Confirms mock data is being used

### 5. **PrecintoTable.tsx**
- `PrecintoTable: Rendering with` - Shows the number of precintos and loading state

### 6. **PrecintoFilters.tsx**
- `PrecintoFilters: Rendering with` - Shows filters and available options

## Error Boundaries Added

- Added a custom ErrorBoundary component that will catch and display React errors
- Wrapped main components (PrecintoFilters, PrecintoTable, PrecintoDetailModal) with error boundaries
- Also wrapped the entire PrecintosPage in App.tsx with an error boundary

## Try-Catch Added

- Added try-catch around the entire return statement in PrecintosPage to catch any rendering errors

## Quick Debug Test

To quickly test if the component is mounting at all, you can uncomment line 15 in PrecintosPage.tsx:
```typescript
return <div className="text-white bg-blue-600 p-4">PrecintosPage is rendering!</div>;
```

## What to Check in Browser Console

1. Open the browser console before navigating to /precintos
2. Clear the console
3. Navigate to /precintos
4. Look for the console logs in order - this will tell you where the flow stops
5. Look for any error messages
6. Check if any error boundaries are catching errors

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Blank page with no console logs**: Route not matching or authentication issue
2. **Logs stop at Layout**: Issue with Layout component or its children
3. **Logs stop at PrecintosPage mounting**: Issue with hooks or state initialization
4. **Logs show data loading but no render**: Issue with the JSX or child components
5. **Error boundary triggered**: Specific React error that will be displayed

## Next Steps

Based on what you see in the console:
1. If you see error messages, share them
2. If logs stop at a specific point, let me know which was the last log you saw
3. If you see the blue debug box when uncommenting line 15, the issue is in the full render logic
4. Check the Network tab to see if any API calls are failing (though we're using mock data in DEV mode)
