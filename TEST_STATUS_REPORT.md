# Test Status Report - CMO Project

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Test Framework Setup**
   - Vitest configured for unit/integration tests
   - Playwright configured for E2E tests
   - MSW configured for API mocking
   - Testing utilities and helpers created

2. **Test Files Created**
   - Unit tests for UI components (Button, Card)
   - Unit tests for auth components (LoginPage)
   - Unit tests for services (precintos.service)
   - Unit tests for utilities (dateUtils)
   - Unit tests for Zustand stores
   - Integration tests for PrecintosPage
   - E2E tests for authentication flows
   - E2E tests for precinto management
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

3. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured
   - Test scripts added to package.json
   - Lighthouse performance testing configured

### ⚠️ Current Issues

1. **Linting Errors** (883 errors, 55 warnings)
   - Mostly `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
   - Many `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
   - Some React hooks violations

2. **Unit Test Issues**
   - Some imports cannot be resolved (missing files)
   - Button size test failing (expects h-10, receives h-9)
   - Need to fix file organization

3. **E2E Test Issues**
   - Tests require the app to be running (`npm run dev`)
   - Some selectors need adjustment for actual UI
   - Login credentials may need updating

### 📝 How to Run Tests

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Start the development server (required for E2E tests)
npm run dev
```

#### Run Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test                    # Watch mode
npm run test:unit          # Run once
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e           # Headless
npm run test:e2e:ui        # With UI
npm run test:e2e:debug     # Debug mode

# All tests
npm run test:all
```

### 🔧 Fixes Needed

1. **Fix Import Paths**
   - Ensure all imported files exist in expected locations
   - Update test imports to match actual file structure

2. **Fix Linting Errors**
   - Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-fix some issues
   - Manually fix remaining TypeScript errors
   - Update ESLint config if needed

3. **Update E2E Tests**
   - Verify login credentials match actual app
   - Update selectors to match current UI
   - Add data-testid attributes for reliable selection

4. **Fix Failing Unit Tests**
   - Update Button component test expectations
   - Ensure mock data matches actual data structures

### 📊 Test Coverage Goals

- Components: >90% coverage
- Services: >85% coverage  
- Stores: >80% coverage
- Overall: >80% coverage

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Fix linting errors to ensure code quality
2. Resolve import issues in test files
3. Update E2E test selectors and credentials
4. Run full test suite with app running
5. Set up pre-commit hooks to run tests
6. Configure test reporting in CI/CD

### 📈 Test Summary

| Test Type | Files | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Unit Tests | 8 | ⚠️ Some failing |
| Integration | 1 | ⚠️ Import issues |
| E2E Tests | 3 | ⚠️ Need app running |
| Total | 12 | 🔧 Needs fixes |

The testing infrastructure is in place but requires some fixes to be fully functional. Once these issues are resolved, the project will have comprehensive test coverage ensuring code quality and reliability.
