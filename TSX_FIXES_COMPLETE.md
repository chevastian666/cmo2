# TSX Files Review and Fixes - Complete

## Summary
All TypeScript and TSX files in the CMO application have been reviewed and fixed. The application is now functional with all critical runtime errors resolved.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Destructuring Pattern Fixes
- Fixed 100+ files with incorrect underscore prefixes in destructuring
- Corrected variable references to match their declarations
- Fixed both simple and aliased destructuring patterns

### 2. Import Statement Fixes
- Fixed React imports (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Fixed lucide-react icon imports
- Ensured all imports match their export names

### 3. Variable Reference Fixes
- Fixed conditional statements (if checks)
- Fixed template literal variable references
- Fixed dependency arrays in React hooks
- Fixed throw statements in catch blocks

### 4. Common Patterns Fixed
```typescript
// Before
const {_data, _error} = useHook();
if (_data) { ... }  // Error: _data is not defined

// After  
const {data, error} = useHook();
if (data) { ... }  // Works correctly
```
